KWIVER v1.2.0 Release Notes
===========================

This is a minor release of KWIVER that provides both new functionality and
fixes over the previous v1.1.0 release.


Updates since v1.1.0
--------------------

Vital

 * Generalized the track and track_state types to be useful for both feature
   and object tracks.  Data that is specific to features or objects is now
   stored in subclasses of track_state.

 * Generalized the track_set to be useful for both feature and object tracks.
   Added derived classes for feature_track_set and object_track_set to
   indicate the type of tracks in the set and provide specialized helper
   functions.  Algorithm APIs previously using track_set now use either
   feature_track_set or object_track_set.

 * Track states now have a pointer (std::weak_ptr) back to the track object
   which contains them.  This means that each track state can belong to at
   most one track, and tracks and track status must now be created and
   referenced only via shared_ptr.  Constructors for track are now protected
   and "make()" static member is used for construction.  A "clone()" function
   is now used for track copy construction.

Vital Bindings

 * Vital C and Python bindings have been updated with respect the refactoring
   of tracks and track_sets to account for both feature and object tracks.
